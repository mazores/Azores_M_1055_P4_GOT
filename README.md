# Game of Thrones Video App

Adding to the Game of Thrones app created in class.


## Description

User will be able to learn about the different Game of Thrones houses through a navigation that, when clicked, slides to the corresponding House's banner and shows the House's description. Then, a lightbox containing a video description pops up.

Video controls were added to the lightbox while the animation and lightbox functionality was fixed to make it happen consecutively instead of synchronously.

## Getting Started

### Installing
